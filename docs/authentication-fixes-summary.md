# Authentication & Database Fixes Summary

## Overview of Changes

We've implemented several fixes to address the authentication issues between Clerk and Supabase:

1. Updated the `auth-sync.tsx` component to use the recommended native Supabase integration with Clerk
2. Enhanced token storage to use both `sessionStorage` and `localStorage` for redundancy
3. Added token validation and expiration checks
4. Created a `useSupabaseAuth` hook to centralize authentication logic
5. Added comprehensive debugging tools and interfaces
6. Created database relationship repair scripts
7. Updated the hooks for fetching notifications and project members

## How to Fix the Authentication Issues

### 1. Update Clerk Integration in Supabase

First, you need to set up the native integration between Clerk and Supabase:

1. Go to the Clerk Dashboard: https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Navigate to the Supabase integration setup: https://dashboard.clerk.com/setup/supabase
3. Select your configuration options and click "Activate Supabase integration"
4. Copy the Clerk Domain that is displayed

5. Go to your Supabase Dashboard 
6. Navigate to Authentication > Sign In / Up > Third-party auth providers
7. Select "Add provider" and choose "Clerk" from the list
8. Paste the Clerk Domain you copied and save the configuration

### 2. Fix Database Relationships

Run the database fix script to ensure proper relationships between the `profiles` and `project_members` tables:

```bash
npm run db:fix
```

This will execute the SQL queries in `scripts/fix-profiles-relationship.sql` to repair the necessary relationships.

### 3. Use the Updated Authentication Utils

The updated code now includes:

- A comprehensive `useSupabaseAuth` hook that manages token refresh and validation
- An enhanced `getAuthenticatedClient()` function that handles token expiration
- Improved storage of auth tokens in both sessionStorage and localStorage
- Automatic token refreshes when API calls fail due to auth errors

Update components that make Supabase calls to use the new pattern:

```typescript
import { useSupabaseAuth } from '@/hooks/useSupabaseAuth';

// In your component
const { getClient } = useSupabaseAuth();

// When making API calls
const fetchData = async () => {
  const client = await getClient(); // Gets a fresh authenticated client
  const { data, error } = await client.from('your_table').select('*');
  // ...
};
```

### 4. Debugging Authentication Issues

We've added several debugging tools to help troubleshoot auth issues:

1. **AuthDebugger Component**: Shows auth status in development mode
2. **Debug Page**: Visit `/debug` to see detailed auth status and test API endpoints
3. **Debug API Endpoint**: `/api/debug/supabase-check` returns detailed auth diagnostics

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check that the token exists and has the correct claims (`role: "authenticated"` and proper `sub` claim)
2. Verify that the Clerk domain is properly configured in Supabase
3. Make sure the database relationships are correctly set up
4. Check the browser console for auth-related messages

### 5. Environment Variables Check

Ensure these environment variables are properly set:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...
```
